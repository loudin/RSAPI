/* PLEASE READ THIS TO ENSURE YOU ARE SETTING EVERYTHING UP PROPERLY.
 * This is an example of how you should set up your routes
 * You must replace the implementation of jsonIdKeyForClass and jsonPropertyMapForClass with your own object model
 * Instructions for jsonIdKeyForClass:(NSString*)className
 * ------------
 * For each Core Data Object, you must return the JSON key your server returns for that particular object.
 * For example, if you have a Core Data Object called User. And let's assume when you download a User object from your server, the 
 * id is labeled as user_id. When jsonIdKeyForClass passes @"User" as the className, you must return @"user_id".
 * Best Practice:
 * On your web server, make the id key for all of your objects @"id". That way, you can always return @"id" no matter what the
 * className is. Then, if there are exceptions, you can construct an if or switch statement that will handle these exceptions.
 *
 * Instructions for jsonPropertyMapForClass:(NSString*)className
 * ------------
 * When you make a request to the server for an object, RSAPI needs to match your JSON data with your Core Data model. 
 * If the names of your JSON attributes exactly match your Core Data attributes, congratulations, you are done.
 * If not, you need to do some customization. In these cases, you must return an NSDictionary that encodes your model's JSON 
 * attributes as objects and your model's Core Data attributes as keys. 
 * For example, if you have a User object that is set up the following way: 
 * User (JSON from Web Server): id, email, hashed_password
 * User (Core Data Model): userID, email, hashedPassword
 * You would write the following:  
 * if ([className isEqualToString:@"User"]){
 *    return [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
              @"id",@"userID",
              @"hashed_password",@"hashedPassword",
              nil];
 * Note that I did not include the email attribute because the JSON and Core Data match here
